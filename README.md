The goal of iqtigprm is to provide an implementation of the statistical methodology for analysing patient survey data as published by the Institute for Quality Assurance and Transparency in Health Care (IQTIG). R-functions are provided to obtain point estimates and uncertainty intervals for patient survey based quality indicators (QI). 

## How to use this package

The package contains a vignette that fully explains the work flow when using `iqtigprm`. The vignette is part of the package, if it is build during installation, i.e. by executing `devtools::install(build_vignettes = TRUE)`. The vignette can then be accessed via `browseVignettes("iqtigprm")`.

Alternatively, the compiled vignette is also contained within the package source files in the `documentation` folder.
